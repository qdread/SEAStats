title: Frequently Asked Questions
---

On this page, I answer FAQs that many scientists have asked me before our first stats consultation. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please feel free to email me or send me a Teams message!

## How can I ask you for help?

## How fast can you get something back to me?

## What kinds of statistical analyses can you help with?

## What information should I provide in a help request?

I can provide you a better answer if I know what the goals of your research are, and if I know what your data look like. I would greatly appreciate it if your help request would include at least a few sentences describing the research, including the goal of the research and what specific research questions you are exploring/hypotheses you are testing. Also, if you can provide at least a sample of your raw data so that I can see what format it is in and what kind of variables we will be working with, that's very helpful too. If you have anything like a field map or spreadsheet of treatment assignments that helps clarify the experimental design, that's also helpful for me to look at. 

With all of that said, don't worry too much about providing every single piece of information. But if I have the info I need to help you ahead of time, it can make our consultation meetings much more efficient and productive!
